# BOARD GAME GRID

## GAME BOARD WITH DRAG'N'DROP FOR PHYSICAL REAL WORLD BOARD GAMES BUILT WITH REACT.

ðŸ’» Drag'n'drop based board game grid to be used as a digital tool for real world board games. Built with React, CSS Grid and ReactDnD. Intended for use with medium to large size touch screens where physical board game figures and markers can be moved around.

ðŸŽ² I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons with my childhood friends (#nobrag #noshame) for more than 20 years but with a 15 year gap. And when we unpacked the box after 15 years â€“ the plastic battle figures still looked awesome but the fold-out paper board that came with the game suddenly seemed useless. We did however have a large size touch screen that we could lay flat on the table, so my mind wandered straight to code. And that's the story behind this odd digital retro board game grid that still relies on real world figures and markers.
